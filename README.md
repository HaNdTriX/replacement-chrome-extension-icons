Each directory is a Chrome Extension with new icons. The source .PSD is in the `Source` directory, and ready to go icons are in the "Icons" folder.

Installation (Mac OS X)
------------
1. Copy icons from the "Icons" directory for the extension you want to replace.
2. Open the extensions folder found at: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/` (CMD + Shift + G in Finder will get you there).
3. The extensions directories don't have a corresponding name to the extension, so hunt through each directory and find the extension that you want to replace the icon for.
4. Copy the new icon from the `Source` directory to the extension directory.
5. Restart Chrome or disable and re-enable the Chrome extension. Voil√†!
