Replacement Icons for Chrome Extensions
=============

I hate things that don't match. In this case, I hate Chrome's extension icons that are random sets of colors and styles. I decided to make replacement icons for the extensions that I love so that they'll all match and blend into the Chrome UI. Replacement icons for more extensions are welcome!

Preface
------------
Each directory in the project is a Chrome Extension with replacement icons. The source .PSD is in the `Source` directory, and ready to go icons are in the `Icons` directory.

Installation (Mac OS X)
------------
1. Clone the repository or download the files using the Github .ZIP download option.
2. Find the extension that you want replacement icons for.
3. Copy the replacement icons from the `Icons` directory for the extension you want to replace.
4. Open the Chrome extensions folder found at: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/` (CMD + Shift + G in Finder will get you there).
5. The extensions directories don't have a corresponding name to the extension, so hunt through each directory of seemingly arbitrary numbers and letters to find the extension that you want to replace the icon for.
6. Paste the replacement icon from the `Icons` directory in to the correct directory in the extension, replacing the icon.
5. Disable and re-enable the Chrome extension, or just restart Chrome to see the new icons. Voil√†!
